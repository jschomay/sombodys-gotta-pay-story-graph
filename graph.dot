SOMEBODY'S GOTTA PAY
--------------------
A murder myster where there is more than meets the eye, and everyone, including the player, is guilty of drawing false conclusions.


IDEAS

Mr Dench in office, on phone, angry, leaves.  Choose to follow, or search office.

If search, find file about you, new motive lead.

Attend funeral or ??.  Meet Ted.

Frank & blackmail
You realize you weren't the one who bungled the embezzlement case, Frank did it on purpose to take the opportunity to blackmail Mr. Dench and blamed you.  You don't have to prove it, you just have to confront him, even if it that isn't true, it will ruin his career.

/*
 What really happened (?):

 Mr. Dench embezzled funds from Mrs. Dench's brother Ted's company.  Ted went bankrupt and was suspcious so he hired you, back at the beginning of your career.  You sought help from Frank, but messed up chain of custody, so the case was thrown out.  Soon after that, Mr. Dench received blackmail letters.  Dench suspected you bungled the case on purpose to blackmail him, and kept a file on you.

Actually, it was his greedy and unscrupulous assistant Bishop who had assisted in the embezzling and saw the opportunity to blackmail Mr. Dench. Eventually Mrs. Dench found a blackmail letter in Bishop's office and took it to confront him.  However Bishop found out and reported her to Mr. Dench, blaming her.  He took the bait and thought perhaps she was working with you, and hatched a scheme to entrap you and his wife.  But when Alice shot Mrs. Dench, he took the opportunity to frame you for her muder, killing two birds with one stone.






Other motivations:

Mrs. Dench was tired of losing money and wanted to stop paying, but Mr. Dench refushed to ruin his name and face charges.
